## About
This repository is a collection of scripts for the manuscript of "A pan-cancer compendium of 1,294 plasma cell-free DNA methylomes and fragmentomes". The structure of the repository is as follows:

Reorganized folder structure: codes are laid out by manuscript section (Methylation processing, Fragmentomics, ML workflows). This logical flow mirrors the paper’s Methods and makes it much easier for reviewers and readers to trace each analysis step end‑to‑end.

  - R_scripts_*: These are R scripts used to generate primary results and figures in Results
  - Shell_Scripts_*: These are ordered scripts for methylomes and fragmentomes analyses.
